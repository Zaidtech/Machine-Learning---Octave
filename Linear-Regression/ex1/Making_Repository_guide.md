## SETTING UP A REPOSITORY (Repo) UNDER THE GIT VERSION CONTROL

### Initializing a new repository: git init
To create a new repo, you'll use the *git init* command. git init is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repo. Executing this command will create a neW *.git*   subdirectory in your current working directory. This will also create a new branch called master.
